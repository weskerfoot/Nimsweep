## What is this?

A simple project that implements a game of minesweeper using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). Mostly as a way for me to learn raylib and Nim more.

## How to build
You must have raylib and raygui installed along with the headers for both of them available.

There is a script to compile raygui as a shared library (raygui.so).

Then do `nimble build` and run the `game` executable.
